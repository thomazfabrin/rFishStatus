\title{Detect invasive species in occurrence data}
\usage{
rfs_detect_invasive(
  occ_df,
  invasive_list = NULL,
  reference_list,
  keep_invasive = TRUE,
  invasive_only = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ_df}{The occurrence data as a data frame. Obtained from
rFishStatus::rfs_join_basins().}

\item{invasive_list}{A dataframe indicating species, basins and if the
species is invasive (1) or not (0). Dataframe must have the columns
'species', 'basin' and 'invasive'.}

\item{reference_list}{A reference database if species obtained from
rFishStatus::rfs_get_species_list().}

\item{keep_invasive}{A logical value indicating whether to keep
invasive species in the occurrence data. Default is TRUE, which
keeps invasive species.}

\item{invasive_only}{A logical value indicating whether to return only
the invasive species in the occurrence data. Default is FALSE,
which returns all species.}
}
\value{
The filtered occurrence data as a data frame.
}
\description{
This function detects invasive species in occurrence data based
on a list of invasive species and a reference list. It can keep or remove
invasive species from the occurrence data, and can also return only the
invasive species from the occurrence data. The function will use a list
of invasive fish species from Paran√° state in Brazil as default in case
no invasive_list is provided. The list was published by
